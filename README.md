Through the use of Pygame, implemented an aesthetically pleasing pathfinding visualizer

Given a start and end node, and any obstacles/walls, the program will illustrate the shortest path if it exists

Mouse: 

	left click - to place the start node, end node, and walls (in that order)
  
	right click - to undo any node or wall

Keyboard: 

	enter - to start the visualizer
  
	p - to rewatch the animation
  
	r - resets all nodes and walls that have been placed
